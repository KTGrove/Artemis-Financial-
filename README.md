# Artemis-Financial-
#Project One of CS 305 SNHU
#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution that required the creation of secure software applications to ensure the safety and privacy of their users financial information. Vulnerability assessments of their existing software and recommendations for secure coding practices.
#What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
The client's concerns were addressed thoroughly through the use of vulnerability assessments. This identified potential security weaknesses. I also outlined mitigation strategies that could be implimented. 
#Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The assessment was challenging as it required in-depth knowledge of secure coding principles and the analysis methodologies. 
#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Through the implimentation of input validation, data encryption, secure libraries and API's, and the avoidance of common vulnerabilities I was able to increase the layers of security. 
#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran vulnerabilty testing and went through to suppress false negatives. After suppression I addressed any remaining vulnerabilities and ran a secondary vulnerabilty test to check if I had produced any new vulnerabilities. 
#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWASP vulnerabilities list, secure coding guidelines, and penetration testing tools were helpful and are resources I may again use in the future. 
#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The in depth testing that was completed and the review of vulnerabilties as well as the mitigation plans that were written. These things will help show employers that I can complete the tedious tasking necessary to improve the security of applications.
